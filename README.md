# OnitamaGameEngine
This project replicates a Japanese board game called Onitama, completed with a GUI that allows two human players to face off against each other. This GUI was created using the Python library tkinter and displays a 5x5 board, 10 pawn pieces, and 5 randomly chosen cards. Each player are given two random opening cards that display the possible movements for his pawn for that round and a 5th card that cannot be played yet. After each round, the cards are rotated in a clockwise position.

A player wins under two conditions:

1. THE WAY OF THE STONE: If any pawn captures their enemy's MASTER pawn
2. THE WAY OF THE STREAM: If any pawn lands on their enemy's shrine
This program requires all files and assets in order to function correctly.

Download "Onitama Game.exe" for easy installation and run the executable to run the game.
